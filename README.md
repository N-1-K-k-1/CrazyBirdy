 It's a simple 2D game made for Android almost on pure Kotlin. 
 In this game, the player plays as a bird and his main task is to eat flies, not letting them go behind his back and collect coins to earn points.
 As the game progresses, the difficulty of the game increases, the speed of the flies becomes higher, and their spawn becomes more frequent.
 The record of collected coins is stored in the application cache.
